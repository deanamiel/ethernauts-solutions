# ethernauts-solutions
My solutions to openzeppelin Ethernauts challenges can be found in the contracts directory. Each filed is named by concatenating the level name with the word attack. Each file contains the ethernauts contract followed by the contract I created to hack the level. A few levels are omitted because I did not need to create smart contracts to hack them.
